                android:text="As well as taking medicine, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children,
teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as
conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD.\n\n
Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below.\n\n
Psychoeducation\n\n
Psychoeducation means you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and its
effects. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with
ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition.\n\n
Behaviour therapy\n\n
Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD and may involve
teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management,
which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD.\n\n
If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as
sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good
behaviour and has a privilege removed for poor behaviour.\n\n
For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities,
and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress.\n\n
Parent training and education programmes\n\n
If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can
help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to
improve their attention and behaviour.\n\n
You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n
These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10 to 12 parents. A programme
usually consists of 10 to 16 meetings, lasting up to 2 hours each.\n\n
Being offered a parent training and education programme does not mean you have been a bad
parent â€“ it aims to teach parents and carers about behaviour management, while increasing
confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.\n\n
Social skills training\n\n
Social skills training involves your child taking part in role-play situations and aims to teach
them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others.\n\n
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n\n
CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you
think and behave. A therapist would try to change how your child feels about a situation,
which would in turn potentially change their behaviour.\n\n
CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group.\n\n
Other possible treatments\n\n
There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful,
such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there's no strong
evidence these work, and they should not be attempted without medical advice.\n\n
Diet\n\n
People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Do not cut out foods before seeking
medical advice.\n\n
Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. If
this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour follows. Discuss
this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises
in nutrition).\n\n
Supplements\n\n
Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be
beneficial for people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited.\n\n
It's advisable to talk to your GP before using any supplements, because some can react
unpredictably with medicine or make it less effective.\n\n
You should also remember that some supplements should not be taken long term, as they can
reach dangerous levels in your body.\n\n"
